# Numerical-Methods
A repository of 33 numerical methods that I coded for MATH 340 (Numerical Analysis).

If you are a student in Numerical Analysis or Mathematical Methods copying these projects to complete an assignment, you are cheating. These are for me to showcase my work, not for you to cheat off of.
